## Description
The events are showing mainly in two panels, Past and Upcoming events, then upcoming events are further divided into multiple event types like Hackaton, Leap, Mission and other. I used a dark theme, I apply premium ribbon to show premium events and distinguish it from other events. I did not use any style framework like bootstrap to it is easy this app to integrate it with the existing application.

## How to Use?
Clone this repo, cd events-app, npm install, npm start
