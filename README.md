## Description
The events are showing in two collapsible panels, Past and Upcoming events, then upcoming events are further divided into multiple event types like Hackaton, Leap, Mission and other.Users will get a notification when click on Premium event, users can also signup for any event from this page. I used a dark theme, I apply premium ribbon to show premium events and distinguish it from other events. I did not use any style framework like bootstrap so it is easy to integrate it with the existing application.

## How to Use?
Clone this repo, cd events-app, npm install, npm start
